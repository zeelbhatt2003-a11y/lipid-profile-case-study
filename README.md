# Cholesterol Screening & Lifestyle Intervention Analysis

## Project Overview
This project is a Grade 12 Independent Biology Investigatory Project conducted to study a real clinical cholesterol report and analyze the impact of **diet control, exercise, and lifestyle changes** on a patient’s lipid profile over time. The study evaluates trends in **total cholesterol, HDL, LDL, triglycerides, and non-HDL cholesterol** using multiple clinical reports collected across a one-year period.

**Student Researcher:** Zeel Bhatt  
**Class:** Grade 12 A  
**School:** Navrachana International School, Vadodara  
**Project Type:** Independent Case Study Research  

## Aim
To study a sample of a cholesterol report and analyze the impact caused due to **diet control and exercise** on the patient.


## Acknowledgements
I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my Biology teacher, **Mr. Sunil Tiwari**, for granting me the opportunity and guidance to conduct this research project on the effect of lifestyle on cholesterol levels. I am also thankful to **Mr. Naimish Panda**, who cooperated fully and provided clinical reports and interviews required for this study. I would also like to thank my parents and friends who supported me in completing this project within the given time frame.

## Introduction: What is Cholesterol?
Cholesterol is a waxy, fat-like substance found in all cells of the human body. The term originates from the Greek words *chole* (bile) and *stereos* (solid). Cholesterol is essential for life as it is required for:

- Formation of cell membranes  
- Production of steroid hormones (testosterone, estrogen, progesterone, cortisol)  
- Synthesis of vitamin D  
- Digestion of fats through bile production  
- Proper functioning of the nervous system  

The human body produces approximately 70–80% of its cholesterol internally in the liver, intestines, adrenal glands, and reproductive organs. Only a small portion comes from dietary sources.


## Cholesterol Transport in the Body
Cholesterol travels through the bloodstream using lipoproteins because it does not dissolve in water.

- **HDL (High-Density Lipoprotein):** “Good cholesterol” that carries cholesterol from tissues to the liver for removal.  
- **LDL (Low-Density Lipoprotein):** “Bad cholesterol” that deposits cholesterol in arteries and increases heart disease risk.  
- **Triglycerides:** A type of fat linked to cardiovascular risk when elevated.

Monitoring blood cholesterol levels helps reduce the risk of **heart attack, stroke, and peripheral artery disease**.


## Foods That Help Reduce LDL Cholesterol
- Oats and whole grains  
- Barley  
- Beans and legumes  
- Eggplant and okra  
- Nuts  
- Vegetable oils  
- Apples, grapes, strawberries, citrus fruits  
- Soy-based foods  
- Fatty fish (rich in omega-3 fatty acids)  
- Fiber supplements (psyllium)

## Causes of High Cholesterol
- Heredity (familial hypercholesterolemia)  
- Excess body weight  
- Lack of physical activity  
- Poor diet  
- Alcohol consumption  
- Mental stress  
- Increasing age  


## Clinical Reference Ranges

| Parameter | Optimal Range |
|----------|----------------|
| LDL Cholesterol | <100 mg/dL |
| Total Cholesterol | <200 mg/dL |
| HDL Cholesterol | >60 mg/dL |
| Triglycerides | <150 mg/dL |
| Non-HDL Cholesterol | <130 mg/dL |


## Procedure
1. Case study of a patient diagnosed with cholesterol imbalance  
2. Analysis of multiple laboratory reports  
3. Assessment of diet, exercise, and supplement intake  
4. Comparison of reports across different months  
5. Observation of physiological trends  
6. Interpretation and conclusions  


## Interpretation of Reports
The subject is a **47-year-old male patient** initially diagnosed with ideal cholesterol levels on **05/05/2018**. After discontinuation of supplements and exercise in December 2018, cholesterol fluctuations were observed.

### Report 1 – 05/05/2018
- Total Cholesterol: Desirable  
- HDL: High  
- LDL: Optimal  
- Triglycerides: Borderline High  
- Non-HDL: Borderline High  

### Report 2 – 08/08/2018
- Total Cholesterol: Desirable  
- HDL: High  
- LDL: Near Optimal  
- Triglycerides: Normal  
- Non-HDL: Desirable  

### Report 3 – 22/12/2018
- Total Cholesterol: Desirable  
- HDL: Low  
- LDL: Near Optimal  
- Triglycerides: Borderline High  
- Non-HDL: Borderline High  

### Report 4 – 16/05/2019
- Total Cholesterol: Desirable  
- HDL: Low  
- LDL: Optimal  
- Triglycerides: Normal  
- Non-HDL: Desirable  

### Report 5 – 24/11/2019
- Total Cholesterol: Desirable  
- HDL: High  
- LDL: Near Optimal  
- Triglycerides: Normal  
- Non-HDL: Borderline High  

## Observations
After inconsistent exercise and poor dietary habits, HDL levels dropped and triglycerides fluctuated. Upon resuming consistent physical activity and maintaining a nutrient-rich diet, cholesterol parameters stabilized and improved.


## Conclusion
This study demonstrates that **consistent exercise, proper diet, and supplement intake play a crucial role in maintaining healthy cholesterol levels**. Irregular lifestyle habits directly contributed to deterioration of HDL levels and increased cardiovascular risk. Once the patient resumed disciplined lifestyle habits, lipid profile parameters improved, confirming the strong relationship between **lifestyle choices and cardiovascular health**.
